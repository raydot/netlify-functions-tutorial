# netlify-functions-tutorial

Following Kyle Mitofsky's [tutorial on Netlify Functions](https://www.thisdot.co/blog/build-your-backend-with-netlify-functions-in-20-minutes)

Overall a good tutorial. Dunno why it's got to focus on DynamoDB though. It would be better if it was just a generic example. I spent a lot of time mucking about in AWS and not really working on the actual serverless issues.

## Caveats

I spent way too much time on this tutorial because I had the region set wrong. So, don't do that.
